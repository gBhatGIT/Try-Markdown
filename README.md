# Try-Markdown
 Experimenting with markdown documents. You can make text bold by double asterisk **bold** or single asterisk for italics *italic* 

 You can identify a short in-line code snippet by enclosing it in a single-back-tic characters, like so: `git init`.

 You can also create lists by using the single dash followed by a space for each line of text.

 so far: 
 - **bold** text
 -  *italic* text 
 -  some `code` samples 
 -  simple lists
 here is a sample of some c# code in what is called a "fenced block", These are created by enclosing multiple lines of text inside triple back-tics, with the first set of triple-back-tics including a reference to the programming language(for syntax highlighting)

 ```csharp
 public static void Main(string[] args){
 	//the canonical "First program"
 	Console.Writeline("Hello world!");
 }
```

This is a really good way to make useful notes. :)

## Making commits 
the key to using markdown and git for taking notes or doing any kind of software dev is to 

- make frequent commits
- Use meaningful messages in your commits

It takes a bit of discipline, but it pays off in the long run.
